A simple widget for adding links to your books for sale on sites like Amazon, Kobo, Nook, etc.

You can upload your book cover image (or choose it from the WordPress Media Library if you've already uploaded it), enter the book title, and add links to 5 separate vendors:

* Amazon

A widget for that book appears in your sidebar with links to all of the vendors you entered. You can add as many book widgets as you would like.
